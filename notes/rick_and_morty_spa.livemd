## Introduction

An exercise in consuming the Rick and Morty API, and presenting it in the form of a single page application (SPA), in Elixir LiveView.

## Preparing to query the API

To simplify querying the Rick and Morty API, we will start with the _base_ API, the first part of the URL which is common to all requests, which is "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api" ([Introduction: REST](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest)).

Using the _base_ URI, we simply concatenate the specific part of the API endpoint to the generic, to get the full API endpoint. For example, to look up the list of characters, we concatenate `/characters` ([Character: Get all characters](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#get-all-characters)) to the base URI to obtain the endpoint to query for character information.

To make this resource reusable, we save the endpoint URI string to the `characters_endpoint` variable for later use.

<!-- livebook:{"reevaluate_automatically":true} -->

```elixir
rick_and_morty_api_base_url = "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/"
character_list_endpoint = rick_and_morty_api_base_url <> "character"
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
"https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character"
```

## Making our first request

With the endpoint URI defined, we can now query the API for a list of all characters. We will use the [`Req`](https://hexdocs.pm/req/readme.html) library to make all our API requests, specifically the `Req.get/1` function, which will make a `GET` HTTP request.

We are storing the result of the endpoint query to the `character_response` variable for later use.

```elixir
character_list_response = Req.get(character_list_endpoint)
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```

The full response to our request comes back in a `{:status, %Req.Response{...}}` tuple. As long as `:status` comes back as `:ok`, we can proceed to deconctruct `%Req.Response{}`, which contains the following key-value pairs: `status`, `headers`, `body`, and a couple more that aren't relevant. `status` is the HTTP response status code ([HTTP response status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)); all we care about is a `200` response status, signifying a successful response. We also don't need to concern ourselves with the response `headers`, so we will ignore that key as well.

We do want the `body`, so we will pattern-match the `body` key inside the `%Req.Response{}` object.

## Getting a list of all Rick and Morty characters from the API

```elixir
{:ok, %{body: body}} = character_list_response

Looking inside the `body`, we can see two keys, `info`, and `results`. Finally, this is an identical response to that we initially obtained using [`curl`](https://curl.se/) and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) API querying tools. A quick inspection demonstrates that the back-end code forming our Elixir application retrieves the same results as those we obtain using these two dedicated and trusted tools.

The [Rick and Morty API documentation](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#info-and-pagination) describes the structure of the first key, `info`, which clearly tells us that all results are paginated into batches of up to 20 documents per page, and that within that object, we will find the following fields:

* `count`: the number of items—_characters_ in our case—that exist
* `pages`: the number of pages (of 20 items per page), that encapsulate all the items
* `next`: the URI to the _next page_ of results, if there is one
* `prev`: the URI to the _previous page_ of results, if there is one

To manage pagination, we will want the individual results returned in this object, providing a variable to store the returned value of each.

Finally, the `results` key is an array (a list) of all the individual character objects returned, each containing all the fields in the _character_ schema. We only want to retrieve the _Avatar_ (field labeled `image`), _Name_, _Species_ and _Staus_ fields, so we will use _nested_ Elixr pattern matching to get them and save them to the relevant variables.

%{
  "info" => %{"count" => count, "next" => next, "pages" => pages, "prev" => prev},
  "results" => results

## Reshaping the data

We now need to reshape, or manipulate the data in our `results` variable, to contain only the four fields we need to use.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Having fetched the data, `Req.get/1` has already converted the response data into Elixir data structures. Can we find out what kind of data structure our `results` variable contains? Yes, using th `i/1` function, defined in the `IEx.Helpers` namespace.

We can see that what was a JSON `array` has now been converted to an Elixir list object.

```elixir
IEx.Helpers.i(results)
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

We can ask for the same introspection on the items in the list. Here, we deconstruct the list into a _head_ (first item) and _tail_ (rest of list), to inspect the type of items we have in the list, and we see that each item is a map.

```elixir
[head | tail] = results
IEx.Helpers.i(head)

Now, we use the `Enum` module to help us enumerate, or _map_ over our resulting tree. This will take the results list, enumerate each item (map) in the list, in order to extract only the four fields that we want, renaming `image` to `avatar` in the process.

A list of maps containing only the four desired fields is returned, ready for later use in building a table listing all characters from the Rick and Morty show.

```elixir
character_list =
  results
  |> Enum.map(fn %{
                   "id" => id,
                   "name" => name,

## Visualising the completed character list

Now, we can use the `kino_explorer` library—built on top of [Explorer](https://hexdocs.pm/explorer/Explorer.DataFrame.html#relocate/3), a tool to _explore_ two-dimensional data—to visualise a table of all our characters.

This is a little detour from the building of our application, but it's useful for us to visualise this information in a tabular view, to ensure that our two-dimensional structure (above), holds the information we actually want to see.

<!-- livebook:{"attrs":{"assign_to":"character_data","collect":true,"data_frame":"character_list","data_frame_alias":"Elixir.Explorer.DataFrame","is_data_frame":false,"missing_require":"Elixir.Explorer.DataFrame","operations":[]},"chunks":null,"kind":"Elixir.KinoExplorer.DataTransformCell","livebook_object":"smart_cell"} -->

```elixir
require Explorer.DataFrame
character_data = character_list |> Explorer.DataFrame.new()
```

We don't like the column order, preferring to have the `avatar` column last, so we reorder the columns ([`relocate/2` function](https://hexdocs.pm/explorer/Explorer.DataFrame.html#relocate/3)).

Next, instead of lowercase key names, we rename ([`rename/2`](https://hexdocs.pm/explorer/Explorer.DataFrame.html#rename/2)) them all to a nicer, capitalised, human representation using `Explorer`.

<!-- livebook:{"reevaluate_automatically":true} -->

```elixir
character_data
|> Explorer.DataFrame.relocate([:id, :name, :species, :status], before: :avatar)
|> Explorer.DataFrame.rename(avatar: "Avatar")
|> Explorer.DataFrame.rename(name: "Name")
|> Explorer.DataFrame.rename(species: "Species")
|> Explorer.DataFrame.rename(status: "Status")
|> Explorer.DataFrame.rename(id: "ID")
```

## Reshaping the data into Elixir `structs`

Phoenix LiveView, our web application framework, doesn't want the data in the form of a list of maps, as maps are too unstructured and _ad hoc_; they could contain fewer or more fields than are expected, for any given row. Instead, it expects the rows to be defined within an Elixir [`struct`](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/structs.html) data structure, one build on top of maps, with the difference that fields must be named and defined, and they will be enforced. This way, LiveView knows for certain—as structs are enforced by compile-time checks—that all the fields must be defined for each row of our character list.

Let's define a structure—in its own module—for the character listing fields.

```elixir
defmodule RickAndMorty.CharacterList do
  @moduledoc """
  Creates a structure holding five fields of information on
  Rick and Morty characters: `id`, `avatar` (image), `name` and 
  `status`.
  """

  defstruct [
    :id,
    :image,
    :name,
    :species,
    :status
  ]

  use ExConstructor
end
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
{:module, RickAndMorty.CharacterList, <<70, 79, 82, 49, 0, 0, 12, ...>>, :ok}
```

Now, we will simply duplicate the data reshaping function we used previously, replacing only the building of the maps representing rows, using the Rick and Morty character list `struct`.

```elixir
character_list_struct =
  results
  |> Enum.map(fn %{
                   "id" => id,
                   "name" => name,
                   "species" => species,
                   "status" => status,
                   "image" => image
                 } ->
    %RickAndMorty.CharacterList{
      id: id,
      name: name,
      species: species,
      status: status,
      image: image
    }
  end)

## Getting a single character profile from the API

With the character list built, we have exactly what we want to present a list of characters. As a user interacts with that list, they will want to see a single character's full profile, which is why we need to query the API to get that information.

As before, we build the API query endpoint by concatenating the generic part of the endpoint "character", followed by the ID of the desired character, as documented: [_Get a single character_](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#get-a-single-character).

```elixir
id = "17"
single_character_endpoint = rick_and_morty_api_base_url <> "character" <> "/" <> to_string(id)
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
"https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/17"
```

As before, we query the API, just this time we will not slowly destructure the results for our needs, but will rather use _deep pattern-matching_ to assign the information we want to variables, succinctly. In this data reshaping action, we are getting all the information specified and provided by the API, creating a `map` object with the results, for consumption in our LiveView application.

```elixir
{:ok,
 %{
   status: 200,
   body: %{
     "id" => id,
     "name" => name,
     "status" => status,
     "species" => species,
     "type" => type,
     "gender" => gender,
     "origin" => %{"name" => origin_name, "url" => origin_url},
     "location" => %{"name" => location_name, "url" => location_url},
     "image" => avatar,
     "episode" => episode,
     "url" => url,
     "created" => created
   }
 }} = Req.get(single_character_endpoint)

%{
  id: id,
  avatar: avatar,
  name: name,
  status: status,
  species: species,
  type: type,
  gender: gender,
  origin: %{origin_name: origin_name, origin_url: origin_url},
  location: %{location_name: location_name, location_url: location_url},
  episode: episode,
  url: url,
  created: created
}
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
%{
  id: 17,
  name: "Annie",
  status: "Alive",
  type: "",
  origin: %{origin_name: "Earth (C-137)", origin_url: "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/location/1"},
  location: %{
    location_name: "Anatomy Park",
    location_url: "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/location/5"
  },
  url: "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/17",
  species: "Human",
  avatar: "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/avatar/17.jpeg",
  gender: "Female",
  episode: ["https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/3"],
  created: "2017-11-04T22:21:24.481Z"
}
```

Even though it's shorter, it is still very verbose and prone to errors, such as misspelling any of the expected keys when converting the result to a map. Fortunately, the `Req` library lets us do much of the work within its middleware; Req is composed of a series of steps which are invisible from its high-level usage, all of which can be modified through passed options.

[`Req.get`](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.html#get/2) offers a wide range of options covered by the [`new/1` request struct](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.html#new/1). For starters, instead of building our very own URL endpoint for every type of request, we can give `Req.get` a `base_url` as well as a `url` key, and it will combine them internally into a complete URL to query. Note that we use `:id` as a placeholder in the path, which we then satisfy with the [`path_params`](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Steps.html#put_path_params/1) option list, substituting the `id` variable with the value of the desired Character ID.

One of the steps taking place in the request is the conversion of the received JSON payload to an internal data structure. By default, the [`Jason.decode`](https://hexdocs.pm/jason/1.4.1/Jason.html#decode/2) function decodes keys as binary strings. To get a map of keys which are atoms, we pass a `decode_json` option, asking for keys to be converted to atoms, specifically existing atoms (atoms already defined in previous requests), because _"... Since the atoms are not garbage collected, this can pose a DoS attack vector when used on user-controlled data"_.

As before, we pattern-match to get the response body, and use that variable for building our character profile.

```elixir
{:ok, %{body: body}} =
  Req.get(
    base_url: rick_and_morty_api_base_url,
    url: "character/:id",
    path_params: [id: id],
    decode_json: [keys: :atoms!]
  )

body
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
%{
  id: 17,
  name: "Annie",
  status: "Alive",
  type: "",
  origin: %{name: "Earth (C-137)", url: "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/location/1"},
  location: %{name: "Anatomy Park", url: "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/location/5"},
  image: "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/avatar/17.jpeg",
  url: "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/17",
  species: "Human",
  gender: "Female",
  episode: ["https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/3"],
  created: "2017-11-04T22:21:24.481Z"
}
```

## Improving the list of characters response

Now that we have explored using `Req.get` in an expanded capacity to take more load off us for a single character profile query, we return full circle and modify our character list query in the same way, to obtain keys as atoms. Let us also extend the query to include page number and `name`parameters.

As we already know from before, our `body` response will contain two keys: `info` and `response`. As this is a misshaped map, we will take the `response` key (our character list), enumerating each map within the list, converting it to the `CharacterList` structure previously defined.

This provides us with the data structure we need for the `index` view, the character list.

```elixir
page = Kino.Input.number("Page number", default: 1)
page = 1
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
1
```

```elixir
name_search = Kino.Input.text("Name to search for", default: "")
name_search = "gonzo"
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
"gonzo"
```

```elixir
{:ok, %{body: body}} =
  Req.get(
    base_url: rick_and_morty_api_base_url,
    url: "character",
    params: [page: page, name: name_search],
    decode_json: [keys: :atoms]
  )

# body.results
# |> Enum.map(fn x -> RickAndMorty.CharacterList.new(x) end)

body
```

<!-- livebook:{"output":true} -->

```
%{error: "There is nothing here"}
```
